# This Python script implements a **Timed Quiz Game** on Indian history.
# Players must answer multiple-choice questions within a **10-second limit** per question.
#
# Key Features:
# 1. **Threading for Timed Input**: A separate thread runs a countdown timer.
# 2. **Randomized Questions**: Questions appear in a random order.
# 3. **Input Validation**: Ensures users enter a valid answer (A, B, C, or D).
# 4. **Automatic Time Expiry Handling**: If the player fails to answer in time, the answer is marked incorrect.
# 5. **Scoring System**: Displays the total score and correct answers after the quiz.
# 6. **Replay Option**: Players can choose to play again.
#
# Use Cases:
# - Can be adapted for **educational quizzes** and **learning platforms**.
# - Suitable for **competitive timed exams** or **trivia games**.
# - A **fun Python project** to practice threading, input handling, and randomization.
