# This Python script implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
# The player competes against the computer, which randomly selects a move.
# The game follows standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:
# - Rock beats Scissors
# - Scissors beat Paper
# - Paper beats Rock
#
# Key concepts covered:
# 1. **Random Selection**: The computer's choice is selected using `random.choice()`.
# 2. **Dictionary for Game Rules**: The rules are stored in a dictionary for easy lookup.
# 3. **Function-Based Structure**: Uses functions for modularity and better code organization.
# 4. **User Input Handling**: Ensures valid input and allows replaying the game.
# 5. **Looping for Continuous Play**: The game continues until the user decides to stop.
#
# Use Cases:
# - A fun way to practice **conditional logic** and **looping** in Python.
# - Can be expanded into a **GUI version** using Tkinter or Pygame.
# - Useful for **learning basic game development concepts**.

# Import the random module for generating the computer's choice

        'scissors': 'paper',  # Scissors beat Paper

    }

    # If both player and computer choose the same, it's a tie
    if player == computer:
        return "It's a Tie!"
    
    # If the player's choice beats the computer's choice based on rules, the player wins
    elif rules[player] == computer:

    # Otherwise, the computer wins
    else:
