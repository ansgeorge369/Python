"""
Simple Greeting Functions
-------------------------
This script defines two basic functions:
1. `hello()`: Prints a friendly greeting message.
2. `bye()`: Prints a farewell message.

Functions in Python allow code reusability and modularity.

def hello():
    print("Hello, World! Have a nice day.")

# Function to print a farewell message
def bye():
    print("Bye, World! Have a nice day.")

# Calling the functions (Optional: Uncomment to test)
